# Community App

This repository houses the early planning and product groundwork for a UC Berkeley-focused community platform that helps exchange and visiting students settle quickly. The MVP centers on a personalized checklist generator, a moderated Q&A forum, and a guide library that captures verified answers in both Korean and English.

## Current Documentation
- `plan.md`: Original project brief, constraints, and required deliverables.
- `AGENTS.md`: Contributor guidelines covering structure, tooling, and collaboration practices.
- `init_plan.md`: Phase roadmap and development tracks derived from the initial plan.

More specs, scaffolding, and implementation code will be added as the MVP build progresses.
