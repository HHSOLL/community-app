# Infra Overview (Stub)

This directory will hold IaC definitions, deployment scripts, and environment configuration templates as the MVP build progresses.

Planned structure:
- `terraform/` – optional Terraform modules for managed services
- `deploy/` – GitHub Actions workflows or shell scripts for CI/CD
- `env/` – shared environment variable templates and secrets management docs
